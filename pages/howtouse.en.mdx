## Startup in 5 minutes

### Step 1: Log in

Access this site using your email.

You must first create your API key on the OpenAI site.
After signing up on OpenAI, visit the developer's site to create a personal key.
This key, an alphanumeric string, is required to activate this app.


You can get your API key by logging in here [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) then going to the page [here](https://platform.openai.com/login).

### Step 2: Store the API Key

Paste your key into the appropriate field on ChatGPT Italia.

### Step 3: Start Chatting

Now you're ready to start chatting. Click on the button at the top left to create a new chat.

### Step 4: Enter the Text

There are three ways to enter text: use plain text input, the Markdown editor, or voice typing.

### Step 5: Use Prompts

A prompt is a predefined command that can specialize the chat for a specific task or character.

### Step 6: Resume Chat from a Specific Point

There are buttons next to each message. If the message was sent from ChatGPT, you can regenerate that message. If the message was generated by you, you can resume the chat from that point by editing the text with the editor.

### Step 7: Filter Chats

If you're looking for a previous chat, you can filter the list by title.

### Step 8: Use the Preset Prompts

On the main page, select a preset prompt to get started.
