## What is prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline that allows to develop and optimize the prompts to efficiently use artificial intelligence language models (LM) for a wide variety of applications and research topics.

Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limits of large language models (LLM).

Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capabilities of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as answering questions and arithmetic reasoning.

Software developers, on the other hand, design robust and effective prompt techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.

Prompt engineering is not just about designing and developing prompts.

It includes a wide range of skills, techniques and tools useful for interacting with and developing LLMs.

It is an important skill for interfacing with, building and understanding the capabilities of LLMs.

It is possible to use prompt engineering to improve the security of LLMs and build new features, such as enhancing LLMs with domain knowledge and external tools.
