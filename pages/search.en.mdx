# Documentation search bar

You will have noticed that at the top right it is possible to activate a search bar which has innovative features from a search point of view.
In fact, it is possible to search for information within this documentation, and obtain answers of different types all together.
The search bar actually uses a prompt to process information from a vector database containing embedded vectors, knowledge of chatgpt, and Bing search.

## Structure of the prompt used

The prompt has a specific structure with certain parts that GPT-3 should pay attention to. Here's what it looks like:

- **Context:** This section defines the context or topic being addressed. It will be used as a key reference by the inferential model to provide relevant answers.

- **Bing search**: This section contains filtered results from a Bing search. They should be used in giving specific answers based on the information available through the network.

- **Question:** This is the specific question that the AI needs to answer.

- **Instructions:** This section gives CHATGPT specific instructions on how the response should be structured. There are three responses that CHATGPT must generate sequentially:

    1. "**Search documentation as context**": The response must be based only on what is written in context.
    2. "**Search documentation as context + chatgpt knowledge**": Your response should leverage both the context we provide and your prior knowledge of GPT-3. Also, it should include an example.
    3. "**Bing Search**": The response should be a summary of relevant Bing search results, structured in a markdown list.

## Results

Once the instructions have been processed, CHATGPT generates three responses based on the given structure.
Each answer has a title that corresponds to the three categories indicated in the instructions.

## Why is this Structure Effective?

Implementing this structure in the personalized prompt allows for greater effectiveness in providing specific, relevant answers and in a structured format that makes communication very clear.
Additionally, the ability to search online resources through Bing further expands GPT-3's breadth of knowledge, giving you the ability to provide more current and relevant answers.
