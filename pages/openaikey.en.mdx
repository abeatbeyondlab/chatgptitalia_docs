# How to Get an OpenAI API Key

Start by visiting the [OpenAI's official platform website](https://platform.openai.com/login). Follow the easy steps to create an account if you haven't already. Alternatively, use your existing Google or Microsoft account credentials to sign in.

Once your account is set up, you'll see your profile icon and name at the top-right corner of OpenAI's platform homepage.

To generate an API Key:

1. Click your name in the top-right corner revealing a dropdown menu.
2. Choose the "View API keys" option.

You'll then be directed to a new page where you'll find an option to "Create new secret key". Click this button if you do not currently have an API key. Don't forget to save your API key immediately since it will no longer be accessible after you close the window.

## Is an OpenAI API Key Free?

Indeed, creating an OpenAI API key doesn't cost you anything, and you get a credit worth $5 (USD) as a new free trial user (this expires after three months). Once this credit has expired or is used up, you'll need to input billing information if you want to continue utilizing the API. Even without entering any billing details, you can still log into your account, although you won't be able to make additional API requests.

Please note that OpenAI enforces rate limits at the organization level. These rate limits are gauged in terms of RPM (requests per minute) and TPM (tokens per minute).

You can find specific pricing details based on your chosen AI model (like GPT-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo) on [OpenAI's AI model pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing). Visit [OpenAI's Rate Limits page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) to understand exact rate limits, examples, and other useful information.
